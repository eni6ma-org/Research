To distribute 40 distinct items evenly into four boxes, each box must contain exactly 10 items, since $\frac{40}{4} = 10$.

The problem is to determine the number of ways to divide 40 distinct items into four groups of 10. This can be solved using the multinomial coefficient, which generalizes the binomial coefficient to multiple groups.

The multinomial coefficient for dividing $n$ items into $k$ groups of sizes $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ is given by:

$$
\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \ldots n_k!}
$$

In this case, we have $n = 40$ and each group size $n_1 = n_2 = n_3 = n_4 = 10$.

Thus, the number of ways to evenly distribute 40 items into four boxes is:

$$
\binom{40}{10, 10, 10, 10} = \frac{40!}{10! \times 10! \times 10! \times 10!}
$$

Calculating this:

1. $40!$ (40 factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to 40.
2. $10!$ (10 factorial) is the product of all positive integers up to 10.

$$
40! = 40 \times 39 \times 38 \times \ldots \times 1
$$

$$
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times \ldots \times 1
$$

Now, using these values:

$$
\binom{40}{10, 10, 10, 10} = \frac{40!}{(10!)^4}
$$

To find the exact number, it is practical to use computational tools, but here's the simplified calculation approach:

$$
\frac{40!}{(10!)^4} \approx 2.35357 \times 10^{21}
$$

So, the number of different ways to evenly distribute 40 distinct items into four boxes is approximately $2.35357 \times 10^{21}$. This is a very large number, reflecting the vast number of possible distributions.
